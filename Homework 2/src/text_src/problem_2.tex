\section*{Problem 2.}
\subsection*{Question}
Using the result for $\Omega_{0}$ calculate $\Omega_{0}$ and $N$ as a function of $(T, V, \mu)$ for a fermionic homogeneous system (non-interacting fermions in a box with periodic boundary conditions). Express your results with Fermi-Dirac integrals. Give the first three terms of the high temperature expansion for $\Omega_{0}$ and $N$.

\subsection*{Solution}
